# Update constraints-dev.txt file

## Overview

This action is used to attempt an update to constraints-dev.txt file that holds
all pins for all dependencies of a project. If any changes are detected, a new
PR will be posted to the corresponding repository.

This action is aligned with the proposed
[total constraints strategy](https://github.com/instructlab/dev-docs/pull/198)
for InstructLab CI.

## Requirements

The project should define a new `constraints` tox target in `tox.ini` file that
will install a particular version of `uv`. It's advised to pin the
`uv` version in the `tox` environment definition to avoid any potential
breakages due to changes in the `uv` tool itself.

Example `tox.ini` entry:

```ini
[testenv:constraints]
description = Generate new constraints file(s)
basepython = {[testenv:py3]basepython}
skip_install = True
skipsdist = true
deps =
    uv==0.7.8
commands = {posargs}
allowlist_externals = *
```

## How to Call this Action

The action is meant to be executed from a separate workflow file. It's advised
to schedule its weekly execution.
